**About this Project:**

The system proposed in this project leverages contemporary research in chaos theory to encrypt and decrypt audio signals in real-time. A Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange initiates our system, which then employs a Hyper-Chaotic Modified Robust Logistic Map (HC-MRLM) to generate encryption keys. These keys are used to transmit audio in a secure and computationally efficient manner. In addition, a Discrete Wavelet Transform is applied before transmission and inverted on reception, creating a working out-of-the-box framework for denoising or lossy compression algorithms. Our system was evaluated on the Telecommunications and Signal Processing Laboratory Speech Dataset based on two parameters: signal latency and spectrogram analysis of the audio signal. Overall, the computational simplicity of our algorithm makes it practically compatible with weaker or older processors and creates a step toward a greater ubiquity of security across devices.
